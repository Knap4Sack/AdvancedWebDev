Youtube Video Downloader

The application that I am proposing for my final project in this class will be a browser pluging for google chrome and mozilla firefox
to download videos off of youtube. There are already a bunch out there but I have never really liked using any of them, plus it would be
cool to learn how it works.

The target audience will be the general public.

The data that it will manage will be the video stream that is pulled from the URL, then write the data to a .flv or .mp4 file. I will
also need to create a decent parser that will parse any valid youtube URI's and pull from those URI's.

The technologies that I will use... Well I have a lot of experience in PHP, so I think I'll try writing this program in Python.

My stretch goals will be:

1) Option to download as mp3 (there is chance of copyright violation, but this is not what the app is intended for, there are lots of non
-licensed media files on youtube that have no download options)

2) A desktop app that provides a convenient interface with what files have been downloaded and creates a library.
